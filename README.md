Please read the project proposal and the view our presentation. High level understanding is that we extracted muscle action potential from 3 different people from our group. We used electromyography (EMG) electrodes to obtain action potential signals and loaded them to biopac and acqknowledge 4.0 to do fast fourier transform (FFT) and root mean square (RMS). Once the data was normalized we wrote an algorithm to move an exoskeleton robotic arm developed by our group members company. The idea is that a person is supposed to be paralyzed and by moving their muscles of the trapezius it will allow them to move the arm (that is paralyzed) that is attached to the exoskeleton. Please video the video to show that it is working.
